# Sellbot Factory Moon

## Information
This mod adds the **Sellbot Factory** from ToonTown as a playable moon. I've stitched together the different zones throughout the main area of the HQ into a functional play area.

## Disclaimer
**Note:** This is my **first time** delving into 3D modeling, and this moon represents my debut in modding. If you have any concerns about the moon's balance, feel free to reach out to me via Discord: **arvemw**.

## Travel
The moon is immediately available upon adding it to the game, with a default price of **140 credits**.

## Installation
To install manually, follow these steps:
1. Extract all files into the **BepInEx plugins folder**.
2. Ensure you have **LethalLevelLoader** and **LethalLib** installed.

For a more automated process, consider using **Thunderstore Manager** or a similar tool.
