# Sellbot Factory Moon

## Information
This mod adds the **Sellbot Factory** from ToonTown as a playable moon. I've stitched together the different zones throughout the main area of the HQ into a functional play area.

## Disclaimer
**Note:** This is my first time delving into 3D modeling, as well as my first time adding a moon to the game. If you have any concerns about the moon's balance or any other aspects of the mod, feel free to reach out to me via my Discord **"arvemw"**.

## Travel
The moon is immediately available upon adding it to the game, with a default price of **140 credits**.

For a more automated process, consider using **Thunderstore Manager** or a similar tool.
